## FlexShopper In-Store Kiosk
The FlexShopper kiosk allows a customer to seamlessly purchase an in-store product from a merchant and leave the store with that product <i>hassle free</i>. The customer can also opt to purchase an item from a merchant and have it shipped.<br>

**Please review the [documentation](file:///Users/Savage/Desktop/apollo/docs/assets/SharedV2EndpointDocumentation.pdf) outlining the requirements for the FlexShopper Kiosk**

The Kiosk uses our [Shared Services](file:///Users/Savage/Desktop/apollo/docs/assets/SharedV2EndpointDocumentation.pdf) to facilitate purchases. 

Generally this is the end of the kiosk life cycle integration. However, if you have the tech to do it and would like to automate some of your processes it is possible to integrate with our API. For more information on automating please contact `integration @ flexshopper.com`.
